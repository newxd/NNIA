# NNIA
Nondominated Neighbor Immune Algorithm (NNIA) is proposed for multiobjective optimization by using a novel nondominated neighbor-based selection technique, an immune inspired operator, two heuristic search operators, and elitism.

NNIA algorithm based on the article   http://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/mggong/Papers/20071010NNIA.pdf

NNIA2 is an improved NNIA,based on the article   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221713007431
