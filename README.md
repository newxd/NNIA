# NNIA
Nondominated Neighbor Immune Algorithm (NNIA) is proposed for multiobjective optimization by using a novel nondominated neighbor-based selection technique, an immune inspired operator, two heuristic search operators, and elitism.
NNIA algorithm based on the article 'Multiobjective Immune Algorithm with Nondominated Neighbor-Based Selection'
NNIA2 is an improved NNIA,based on the article 'Resource allocation model and double-sphere crowding distance for evolutionary multi-objective optimization'
The two articles are in dictionnary /article
